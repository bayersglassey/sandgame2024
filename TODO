* Materials
    * Add a Material class, instead of separate global structures like DENSITY etc
    * Wind (pushes things sideways, maybe similar to how Person pushes)

* Add plants, animals, bugs
    * Fish & bears beside a stream, please
    * Plants grow in the light, mushrooms in the dark

* Finish Person
    * Fix pushing... maybe replace with digging/swimming?.. i.e. freely move
      around, switching your pixels with those directly in front of you,
      instead of pushing a line of pixels.
    * Add grabbing/dropping a chunk of materials
    * Rectangular person (i.e. width > 1), not just a line?..
        * Yeah!.. then we can have bears, which are giant rectangles!..
    * Add multiple people?.. with some kind of AI?..
        * Or even non-people?.. animals etc?.. even horizontal ones?.. fish?.. worms?..
    * Zoom in on the person?.. and add scrolling?..

* Weather patterns
    * Rain, sandstorm, wind
        * Combos?..
        * They should only appear in places touched by sun!
          I.e. no weather in the shade.
    * Sunshine?.. day/night?..
      Colours should interpolate between keyframe colours for each of the
      4 stages of the day.
      Also, need a nicer slope algorithm or whatever.
    * Heat/cold/wetness/etc of person.
      Each level can specify the temperature of its sun at each of the 4
      stages of the day.
