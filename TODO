* Better editor controls
    * Do the 5-pixel horiz line by default
        * Toggle single-pixel or column modes with keypresses (not holding ctrl/shift)
    * Select materials with numbers or QWEASD or something

* Finish materials
    * Density (integer, denser materials displace lighter ones)
    * Solidity (boolean, whether Person can stand on it)
    * Add some simple materials
        * Waterspout/sandspout (continuously produces water/sand)
            * Corresponding sink(s), which consume water/sand?..
        * Oil (denser than water)
        * Brick/wood (doesn't fall left/right)
            * Can support itself sideways so we can build roofs out of it?..
    * Wind (pushes things sideways, maybe similar to how Person pushes)

* Add plants

* Finish Person
    X When you move, move your pixels too ;) 
    * Add velocity?..
        * Maybe just a chonky horizontal pseudo-velocity, similar to JUMP_HANG?..
    * Push pushable materials
        X e.g. sand, water can be pushed left/right/up
        * water you should sink into... does it teleport from your feet to above your head?..
    * Add digging/grabbing a chunk of materials
    * Rectangular person (i.e. width > 1), not just a line?..
    * Add multiple people?.. with some kind of AI?..
        * Or even non-people?.. animals etc?.. even horizontal ones?.. fish?.. worms?..

* Weather patterns
    * Rain, sandstorm, wind
        * Combos?..
    * Sunshine?.. day/night?..

* "Levels"
    * So, save images locally & serve 'em up
        * Currently we can save/load raw bytes, but can we do PNG?
    * How are they tied together?.. do we connect them in a map?.. doors?.. goals?..
