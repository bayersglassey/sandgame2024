* Look into fullscreen!
    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullscreen
    * I tried it, i.e. canvas.requestFullscreen(), and it worked but then the
      pointer coordinates were off.
      Currently we're using event.offsetX, event.offsetY for all pointer events
      to update our pointer_x, pointer_y.

* Make the map wrap horizontally (possibly optionally)

* Materials
    * Add a Material class, instead of separate global structures like DENSITY etc
    * Wind (pushes things sideways, maybe similar to how Person pushes)
        * Wind doesn't currently push rain. I think we need WIND particles,
          plus a global wind speed/direction, e.g. wind_dx.
          And then we can add a RAIN material, which moves like WIND, except
          that when it touches anything else, it turns into WATER?..
          Except that rain's horizontal and vertical movement should really be
          combined somehow.
          Does RAIN do push_x like WIND?.. nahhh.
          So RAIN's behaviour is totally unique, I think.
    * Solidity should be something like a *probability* of person to get through.
      NOTHING: 0
      WATER: .25
      OIL: .5
      SAND: .75
      STONE: 1
      ...hmmm, didn't quite work. E.g. the "walking up a slope" doesn't make
      sense anymore.
      I think we need separate concepts of solidity and... viscosity?.. which
      slows people down.

* Add plants, animals, bugs
    * Fish & bears beside a stream, please
    * Plants grow in the light, mushrooms in the dark

* Finish Person
    * Fix pushing... maybe replace with digging/swimming?.. i.e. freely move
      around, switching your pixels with those directly in front of you,
      instead of pushing a line of pixels.
    * Add grabbing/dropping a chunk of materials
    * Rectangular person (i.e. width > 1), not just a line?..
        * Yeah!.. then we can have bears, which are giant rectangles!..
    * Add multiple people?.. with some kind of AI?..
        * Or even non-people?.. animals etc?.. even horizontal ones?.. fish?.. worms?..
    * Zoom in on the person?.. and add scrolling?..

* Weather patterns
    * Rain, sandstorm, wind
        * Combos?..
        * They should only appear in places touched by sun!
          I.e. no weather in the shade.
    * Sunshine?.. day/night?..
      Colours should interpolate between keyframe colours for each of the
      4 stages of the day.
      Also, need a nicer slope algorithm or whatever.
    * Heat/cold/wetness/hunger/etc of person.
      Each level can specify the temperature of its sun at each of the 4
      stages of the day.
    * Evaporation!.. times of day have associated heats in light/shade.
      When water is in light at a certain heat, it can randomly become steam.
      Steam is like smoke: a rising fluid. It doubles as a "cloud".
      Rain cloud: like steam, but changes steam it touches into more rain cloud,
      and eventually dissolves as rain.
    * Wind which picks up sand & makes it a fluid for a bit.
