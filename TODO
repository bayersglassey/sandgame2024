* Fix bugs
    * The way FRAMERATE is used right now, we add it onto however much time
      step + render already took!..


* Better editor controls
    X Do the 5-pixel horiz line by default
        X Toggle single-pixel or column modes with keypresses (not holding ctrl/shift)
    X Select materials with numbers or QWEASD or something
    X Show selected material somewhere

* Finish materials
    X Density (integer, denser materials displace lighter ones)
    X Solidity (boolean, whether Person can stand on it)
    X Add some simple materials
        X Waterspout/sandspout (continuously produces water/sand)
            X Corresponding sink(s), which consume water/sand?..
        X Oil (denser than water)
          ...oh actually, *less* dense ;) i.e. floats on water
        X Brick/wood (doesn't fall left/right)
            X Can support itself sideways so we can build roofs out of it?..
              Yes, although actually it ends up supporting itself in midair,
              which I didn't expect.
              Also, now it's pushable and pink. O_o
    * Add a Material class, instead of separate global structures like DENSITY etc
    * Wind (pushes things sideways, maybe similar to how Person pushes)

* Add plants, animals, bugs
    * Fish & bears beside a stream, please

* Finish Person
    X When you move, move your pixels too ;) 
    X Add velocity?..
        X Maybe just a chonky horizontal pseudo-velocity, similar to JUMP_HANG?..
          NAAAHHH -- I tried it, didn't feel good.
    X Push pushable materials
        X e.g. sand, water can be pushed left/right/up
        X water you should sink into... does it teleport from your feet to above your head?..
    * Add digging/grabbing a chunk of materials
    * Rectangular person (i.e. width > 1), not just a line?..
        * Yeah!.. then we can have bears, which are giant rectangles!..
    * Add multiple people?.. with some kind of AI?..
        * Or even non-people?.. animals etc?.. even horizontal ones?.. fish?.. worms?..
    * Zoom in on the person?.. and add scrolling?..

* Weather patterns
    * Rain, sandstorm, wind
        * Combos?..
    * Sunshine?.. day/night?..

* "Levels"
    X So, save images locally & serve 'em up!
      Currently we can save/load raw bytes, but can we do PNG? Yes.
      But we need to save various kinds of metadata, to... width, height,
      people, etc. I think we can just append a JSON blob to the raw PNG data?.. Yes.
    * How are they tied together?.. do we connect them in a map?.. doors?.. goals?..
