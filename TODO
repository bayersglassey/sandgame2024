* Materials
    * Add a Material class, instead of separate global structures like DENSITY etc
    * Wind (pushes things sideways, maybe similar to how Person pushes)
        * Wind doesn't currently push rain. I think we need WIND particles,
          plus a global wind speed/direction, e.g. wind_dx.
          And then we can add a RAIN material, which moves like WIND, except
          that when it touches anything else, it turns into WATER?..
          Except that rain's horizontal and vertical movement should really be
          combined somehow.
          Does RAIN do push_x like WIND?.. nahhh.
          So RAIN's behaviour is totally unique, I think.
    * Solidity should be a *probability* of person to get through.
      NOTHING: 0
      WATER: .5
      SAND: .75
      STONE: 1

* Add plants, animals, bugs
    * Fish & bears beside a stream, please
    * Plants grow in the light, mushrooms in the dark

* Finish Person
    * Fix pushing... maybe replace with digging/swimming?.. i.e. freely move
      around, switching your pixels with those directly in front of you,
      instead of pushing a line of pixels.
    * Add grabbing/dropping a chunk of materials
    * Rectangular person (i.e. width > 1), not just a line?..
        * Yeah!.. then we can have bears, which are giant rectangles!..
    * Add multiple people?.. with some kind of AI?..
        * Or even non-people?.. animals etc?.. even horizontal ones?.. fish?.. worms?..
    * Zoom in on the person?.. and add scrolling?..

* Weather patterns
    * Rain, sandstorm, wind
        * Combos?..
        * They should only appear in places touched by sun!
          I.e. no weather in the shade.
    * Sunshine?.. day/night?..
      Colours should interpolate between keyframe colours for each of the
      4 stages of the day.
      Also, need a nicer slope algorithm or whatever.
    * Heat/cold/wetness/etc of person.
      Each level can specify the temperature of its sun at each of the 4
      stages of the day.
